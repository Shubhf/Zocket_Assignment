            "Summary: Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (born 19 April 1957) is an Indian billionaire and businessman who is the chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries. [8][9][10][11][12] In October 2024, Ambani was ranked 1st on the Forbes list of India's 100 richest tycoons, with a net worth of $119.5 billion. [13] Ambani was born on 19 April 1957 in the British Crown colony of Aden (present-day Yemen) into a Gujarati Hindu family to Dhirubhai Ambani and Kokilaben Ambani. [14] Ambani lived only briefly in Yemen because his father decided to move back to India in 1958 to start a trading business that focused on spices and textiles. [18] The family's financial status slightly improved when they moved to India but Ambani still lived in a communal society, used public transportation, and never received an allowance. [19] Dhirubhai later purchased a 14-floor apartment block called 'Sea Wind' in Colaba, where Ambani and his brother lived with their families on different floors. [20] Ambani attended the Hill Grange High School at Peddar Road, Mumbai, along with his brother and Anand Jain, who later became his close associate. [23][24] Ambani later enrolled for an MBA at Stanford University (where Steve Ballmer was his classmate[25]) but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance, which at the time was still a small but fast-growing enterprise. \"[23] Mukesh Ambani set up Reliance Infocomm Limited (later Reliance Communications Limited), which was focused on information and communications technology initiatives. [27] Ambani directed and led the creation of the world's largest grassroots petroleum refinery in Jamnagar, India, which could produce 660,000 barrels per day (33 million tonnes per year) in 2010, integrated with petrochemicals, power generation, port, and related infrastructure. [28] In December 2013, Ambani announced the possibility of a \"collaborative venture\" with Bharti Airtel in setting up digital infrastructure for the 4G network in India. [32] As of 2015, Ambani ranked fifth among India's philanthropists, according to China's Hurun Research Institute. [34] As of 2016, Ambani was ranked as the 36th richest person in the world and has consistently held the title of India's richest person on Forbes magazine's list for the past ten years. [40] Through Reliance, Ambani also owns the Indian Premier League franchise Mumbai Indians and is the founder of the Indian Super League, a football league in India. [54][55][56][57][58] He married Nita Ambani in 1985 and they have two sons, Akash (born 23 October 1991) and Anant (born April 10, 1995),[60] and a daughter, Isha Ambani, who is Akash's twin. [66] Ambani was titled \"The World's Richest Sports Team Owner\" after he purchased the IPL cricket team Mumbai Indians for $111.9 million in 2008. [71] In early 2019, a court in Mumbai held his younger brother, Anil Ambani, in criminal contempt for non-payment of personally guaranteed debt Reliance Communications owed to Swedish gearmaker Ericsson. [74] On July 12 to 14, 2024, the wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant was held as a three-day event that took place at the Antilia building and Jio Convention Center in Mumbai.\n"
